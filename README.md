Family todo web-based fullstack application written in JavaScript. The Frontend was built in React.js and Bootstrap for the responsive and clean design for increase the user experience. The Server is a Node.js server, written in JavaScritpt, and uses express.js. To store datas, this application use MongoDB, which one is a NoSql database. Our plan is create multiple docker images for every services like frontend, backend, and the database.
